description: 'Initialize SDD on an existing (brownfield) project — generates shared docs by inspecting the codebase and interviewing the user'
---

Bootstrap the SDD workflow on a **brownfield** project — one where code already exists and no SDD documents have been created yet.

This skill reverse-engineers the shared project documents from the existing codebase and a targeted conversation with the user, then writes them to the standard SDD locations so the full SDD workflow can proceed normally.

This covers:
- Creating `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prd.md` — what the product does and why
- Creating `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/architecture.md` — how the system is built today
- Creating `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/ux.md` + HTML prototype — **only** if a UI layer is detected
- Initializing `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/sdd-tracker.yml`

---

## Entry point

**Before doing anything else**, check whether shared SDD documents already exist:

1. Try to read `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prd.md`.
2. If it **exists**, stop and inform the user:
   > "SDD shared documents already exist for this project. `/sdd-init` is intended for first-time setup.
   > To update existing docs use `/sdd-prd`, `/sdd-arch`, or `/sdd-ux` directly.
   > To re-initialize from scratch, delete the `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/` folder first and run `/sdd-init` again."

   Do **not** proceed past this point if the PRD already exists.

3. If no shared docs exist, continue with **Step 1** below.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Codebase reconnaissance

Systematically inspect the project to extract as much context as possible before asking the user anything.

**Structural inventory** — read and parse:
- `README.md` (or `README.*`) at project root — primary source of intent
- `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `pyproject.toml` / `go.mod` / build manifests — tech stack, scripts, dependencies, version
- Lock files — to verify actual installed dependency versions
- `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/` — any existing documentation
- CI/CD config (`.github/workflows/`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) — deployment context
- `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `api/` — source structure

**Codebase analysis** — derive:
- **Project type**: web app, API, CLI, mobile, library, monorepo, etc.
- **Tech stack**: language(s), frameworks, databases, ORMs, auth libraries, test runners, build tools
- **Entry points**: main scripts, API routers, page routes, CLI commands
- **API surface** (if applicable): list top-level routes or endpoints found in source
- **UI presence**: does source contain frontend code, templates, or components? If yes, note the framework (React, Vue, HTML templates, etc.)
- **Test coverage signals**: are tests present? What framework?
- **Dependency health signals**: notably outdated or security-sensitive packages
- **Scale / deployment hints**: multi-service? cloud platform? containerized?

Build a **Reconnaissance Report** and present it to the user as a structured summary:

```
🔍 Reconnaissance complete

Project: <name>
Type: <web app | API | CLI | library | monorepo | ...>
Stack: <language>, <framework>, <database>
Entry: <main entry points>
UI: <yes — React / no>
Tests: <yes — Vitest / no>
Deployment: <Docker, AWS, Vercel, unknown>

Files read: <count>
Key observations:
  - ...
  - ...
```

Ask: _"Does this match your understanding of the project?"_ Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Step 2 — Targeted gap-filling interview

Ask **only** the questions whose answers cannot be inferred from the code. Present them as a numbered list in a single message so the user can answer all at once.

Standard questions (always ask):

1. **Product vision** — What problem does this tool/product solve, and for whom? _(The README rarely captures the full "why".)_
2. **Current users** — Who uses it today? Are they internal (team), external (customers), or both?
3. **What's working well** — Which parts of the product are you most confident in and want to keep stable?
4. **Known pain points** — What areas of the product need the most improvement or are most fragile?
5. **Near-term roadmap** — Any features or changes already planned that aren't in the code yet?

Conditional questions (ask only if the answer isn't in the code):

- If **no README or minimal README**: _"Can you describe in 2–3 sentences what this project does?"_
- If **UI detected**: _"Is UX documentation needed? Should I also generate a UX design doc and a prototype?"_
- If **monorepo detected**: _"Which package(s) should the SDD docs focus on? All of them, or a specific one?"_
- If **no tests found**: _"Is the lack of tests a known gap, or is testing handled differently (manual, external QA)?"_

After the user responds, confirm:
> "Got it. I have everything I need. Proceeding with document generation — PRD → Architecture → UX (if applicable). I'll report back when done."

Do **not** ask any more questions after this confirmation.

### Step 3 — Run the pipeline

Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track pipeline progress through the phases below.

> **Execution rules (same as `sdd-propose`):**
> - Phases 1 and 2 MUST each be dispatched via `runSubagent`.
> - Phase 3 (UX) runs via `runSubagent` only if UI was detected and user confirmed UX doc is needed.
> - Each subagent prompt must be completely self-contained: include all findings, context, rules, and expected output format.
> - Run phases sequentially — each phase may supply context to the next.

---

#### Phase 1 — Generate PRD

Launch a **subagent** (via `runSubagent`) with a prompt that:
 
 - Instructs it to read `sdd-team/agents/sdd-pm.agent.md` (**sdd-team:sdd-pm.agent**) and adopt the PM agent persona
- Provides the full Reconnaissance Report (Step 1) and gap-filling answers (Step 2) as input
- Instructs it to use `./assets/prd.md` as the document structure
- States the key constraint: **this is a brownfield PRD** — it documents the current state of the product, not a greenfield vision. Sections such as Success Criteria and Scope should reflect what the product _already does_, with placeholders where the information is unknown.
- Sets `Context: brownfield` in the Executive Summary classification block
- Instructs it to write to `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prd.md`
- Instructs it to set the `Last updated` date to today
- Asks for a one-paragraph summary of what was written

Use the returned summary as context for Phase 2.

---

#### Phase 2 — Generate Architecture doc

Launch a **subagent** (via `runSubagent`) with a prompt that:
 
 - Instructs it to read `sdd-team/agents/sdd-architect.agent.md` (**sdd-team:sdd-architect.agent**) and adopt the Architect agent persona
- Provides the full Reconnaissance Report and the Phase 1 summary as input
- Instructs it to use `./assets/architecture.md` as the document structure
- States the key constraint: **this is a brownfield architecture doc** — it documents decisions that were _already made_ in the codebase, not future decisions. Every decision row should be filled with what is actually in use; use "unknown / not documented" only if genuinely unclear after reading the source.
- Instructs it to focus especially on: actual tech stack (from package manifests), database/ORM in use, auth approach found in code, API style and route structure, any documented conventions or linting rules
- Instructs it to write to `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/architecture.md`
- Instructs it to set the `Last updated` date to today
- Asks for a one-paragraph summary of what was written

---

#### Phase 3 — Generate UX doc (conditional)

**Run this phase only if:**
- A UI layer was detected in Step 1, **AND**
- The user confirmed in Step 2 that a UX doc is needed

Launch a **subagent** (via `runSubagent`) with a prompt that:
 
 - Instructs it to read `sdd-team/agents/sdd-ux.agent.md` (**sdd-team:sdd-ux.agent**) and adopt the UX Designer agent persona
- Provides the Reconnaissance Report, the PRD summary (Phase 1), and the architecture summary (Phase 2) as input
- Instructs it to use `./assets/ux.md` and `./assets/prototype-template.html` as document structure
- States the key constraint: **this is a brownfield UX doc** — it documents the design patterns, components, and flows that _already exist_ in the product. The prototype should reflect the current UI, not a redesign.
- Instructs it to write `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/ux.md` and `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prototype-[project-name].html`
- Instructs it to set the `Last updated` date to today

If this phase is skipped, note it in the completion summary.

---

### Step 4 — Initialize tracker

Follow the **`sdd-tracker` skill** to initialize `{ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/sdd-tracker.yml`:

- Create the tracker file from the template.
- Set `project.name` from the project's package.json / folder name.
- Set `project.created` and `project.lastUpdate` = today.
- Mark only the shared artifacts that were actually written:
  - `shared.prd` — always (created in Phase 1)
  - `shared.architecture` — always (created in Phase 2)
  - `shared.ux.ux` and `shared.ux.prototype` — only if Phase 3 ran
- Add a changelog entry for each artifact: `{ date: <today>, note: "Initialized from brownfield codebase inspection" }`

---

### Step 5 — Completion report

Show a structured summary:

```
✅ SDD initialized for brownfield project

Documents created:
  ✅ {ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prd.md
  ✅ {ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/architecture.md
  [✅ | ⏭️ skipped] {ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/ux.md
  [✅ | ⏭️ skipped] {ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/{SHARED_SUBFOLDER}/prototype-<name>.html
  ✅ {ARTIFACT_MAIN_FOLDER}/sdd-tracker.yml

What to do next:
  → Review the generated docs and correct anything that doesn't match reality.
  → Use /sdd-prd, /sdd-arch, or /sdd-ux to refine any document interactively.
  → When ready, use /sdd-propose <change-name> to start your first change.
```

## Guardrails

- **Never overwrite existing shared docs**
- **Code is the ground truth** — prefer what's in the source over what's in any README if they conflict; flag the discrepancy.
- **No aspirational content** — do not fill sections with ideal/future decisions. Use "unknown / not documented" for gaps.
- **Single interview round** — ask all gap-filling questions at once in Step 2. Do not ask follow-up questions between phases.
- **Subagents are autonomous** — each subagent prompt must be self-contained. Do not rely on shared state between subagents.
- **UX phase is gated** — never generate a UX doc if no UI was detected, even if the user requests it in Step 2.
- **Validate outputs** — after each phase, verify the output file exists before proceeding to the next phase.
