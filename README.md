# AINE Plugin Collection — GitHub Copilot Agent Plugins

AINE is a collection of GitHub Copilot Agent Plugins, each designed to embed a specialized workflow directly into your editor. This repository hosts multiple plugins that share a common build pipeline and can be installed independently.

```

Source files live in `src/`. Each subdirectory of `src/` is treated as an independent plugin and materialized into the corresponding `plugins/<name>/` directory by `npm run build`.

---

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build script automatically discovers all plugin directories inside `src/` and for each one:

- Copies agents, skills, and templates into `plugins/<plugin-name>/`
- Converts `.prompt.md` files into skill `SKILL.md` files
- Places the final `plugin.json` at `plugins/<plugin-name>/.github/plugin/plugin.json`

To add a new plugin, create a new directory under `src/` with a `plugin.json` and any agents, prompts, and templates — the build will pick it up automatically.

### Validate

```bash
npm run plugin:validate
```

Validates that all paths referenced in every `plugin.json` point to existing files.
